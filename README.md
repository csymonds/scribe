# scribe
Transcribes .mp4 files using OpenAI's Whisper API

This will create a UI that lets you use a filepicker to select multiple .mp4 files.
Currently that's the only filetype it handles (cause that's what I work with) but it would not be hard to support others.
It will copy the file into smaller chunks to ensure they do not exceed Whisper's filesize limit.
You have the option of whether you want to keep the chunks or not.

## Setup and Running Scribe

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    Documentation for the [OpenAI's Whisper API is available here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)


2. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:csymonds/scribe.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory
   
   ```bash
   $ cd scribe
   ```

4. Virtualize (Note: Non-Windows users will see `venv/bin/activate`)
   ```
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

5. Install the library dependencies
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Add your OpenAI key to use whisper

   Step 1: Make a copy of the example environment variables files

   ```bash
   $ cp example_key_openai.txt key_openai.txt
   ```

   Step 2: Copy in your key to the respective file

    Add your [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `key_openai.txt` file

7. Run scribe - the UI will let you pick the files you want to transcribe
    ```
    $ python.exe .\transcribe.py
    ```

7. Don't forget to deactivate when you have finished!
   ```
   $ deactivate
   ```
