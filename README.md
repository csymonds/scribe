# scribe
Transcribes media files using OpenAI's Whisper API

This will create a UI that lets you use a filepicker to select multiple media files.
The supported filetypes are any common types shared by Whisper and pydub's Audiosegment
These include: *.mp4 *.mp3 *.wav *.flac *.ogg *.aac *.aiff *.caf and *.m4a
It will copy the file into smaller chunks to ensure they do not exceed Whisper's filesize limit.
You have the option of whether you want to keep the chunks or not.
It will then save the concatenated transcription to a .txt file
** As of 07/16 I have not built any robust error handling into as of yet, so use at your own risk **

   $ . venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

5. Install the library dependencies
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
