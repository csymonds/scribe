# scribe
Transcribes media files using OpenAI's Whisper API

This will create a UI that lets you use a filepicker to select multiple media files.
The supported filetypes are any common types shared by Whisper and pydub's Audiosegment
These include: *.mp4 *.mp3 *.wav *.flac *.ogg *.aac *.aiff *.caf and *.m4a
It will copy the file into smaller chunks to ensure they do not exceed Whisper's filesize limit.
You have the option of whether you want to keep the chunks or not.
It will then save the concatenated transcription to a .txt file

**Security Note:** This app now uses environment variables for API key storage instead of text files, which is much safer for protecting your credentials.

**API Update:** Updated to use the modern OpenAI Python library (v1.0+) with the new client-based approach for Whisper API calls.

** As of 07/16 I have not built any robust error handling into as of yet, so use at your own risk **

## Setup and Running Scribe

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    Documentation for the [OpenAI's Whisper API is available here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)


2. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:csymonds/scribe.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory
   
   ```bash
   $ cd scribe
   ```

4. Virtualize (Note: Non-Windows users will see `venv/bin/activate`)
   ```
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

5. Install system dependencies (macOS with Homebrew)
   ```bash
   $ brew install ffmpeg tcl-tk
   ```
   
   **Note:** FFmpeg is required by `pydub` for audio file processing. On other systems:
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg python3-tk`
   - **Windows:** Use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) to install ffmpeg
   
6. Install the library dependencies
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Note:** This will install OpenAI library v1.0+ which has a different API structure than older versions. If you have an older version installed, you may need to upgrade.
   
   **Python 3.13+ Note:** If you're using Python 3.13+, the `audioop-lts` package will be automatically installed to replace the removed `audioop` module that `pydub` depends on.

7. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable

   Add your [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) as an environment variable:

   **On macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   $ export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```cmd
   $ set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell
   $ $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   For a permanent solution, add the environment variable to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) or system environment variables.

8. **Troubleshooting tkinter (GUI) issues:**
   
   If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'` error, your Python installation doesn't have GUI support. This commonly happens with pyenv installations.
   
   **For pyenv users on macOS:**
   ```bash
   $ pyenv uninstall 3.13.5
   $ pyenv install 3.13.5
   ```
   
   **Alternative:** Use a different Python installation method like the official Python installer from python.org which includes tkinter by default.

9. Run scribe - the UI will let you pick the files you want to transcribe
    ```
    $ python transcribe.py
    ```

10. Don't forget to deactivate when you have finished!
   ```
   $ deactivate
   ```
